# gobrik-3.0

GoBrik is the ecobrick and plastic transition management platform developed and maintained by the Global Ecobrick Alliance.  This is the thrid version of our app that manifests our complete transition from the knack.com database platform to our own self hosted mysql database.  GoBrik 3.0 integrates seemlessly with ecobricks.org and our Bhuwana user credential login system.
