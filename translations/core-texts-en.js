    "ecobrick-title": "The Term",
    "ecobrick-text": "In 2016, plastic transition leaders around the world agreed to use the non-hyphenated, non-capitalized term 'ecobrick' as the consistent, standardized term of reference in the guidebook and their materials. In this way, ecobrickers around the world would be able to refer with one word to the same concept, and web searches and hashtags would accelerate global dissemination. See wikipedia.org/ecobricks for the full history.",

    "watershed-text": "A watershed is an area of land where all the water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point, typically a river, lake, or ocean. These basins are a natural boundary that captures and channels precipitation through a network of rivers, streams, and underground aquifers, eventually directing the water to a common outlet. Watersheds play a crucial ecological role and provide water for human use. The health and management of watersheds are vital for ecological vitality.",

    "ocean-text": "Ocean ecobricks are designed for plastics found on beaches, rivers, and in the ocean where plastics tend to be large, chunky, dirty, and wet, and are not suited to make a regular ecobrick. An ocean ecobrick enables these plastics to be easily transformed into a practical, useful, and reusable building block.",
