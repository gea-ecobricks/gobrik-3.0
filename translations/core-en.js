    "watershed-title": "Watersheds",
    "watershed-text": "A watershed is an area of land where all the water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point, typically a river, lake, or ocean. These basins are a natural boundary that captures and channels precipitation through a network of rivers, streams, and underground aquifers, eventually directing the water to a common outlet. Watersheds play a crucial ecological role and provide water for human use. The health and management of watersheds are vital for ecological vitality."
